// nonClosablePlugin wraps a *Sampler so that it can be attached to one
// or more Runners via runner.WithPlugins(...) without the Runner being able
// to close the underlying sampler when Runner.Close runs.
//
// The wrapper implements plugin.Plugin (Name + Register) but deliberately
// does NOT implement plugin.Closer (no Close(ctx) method). That absence is
// load-bearing: plugin.Manager.Close checks every plugin via a type
// assertion `p.(Closer)` because this wrapper type has no Close method,
// the assertion fails and the manager skips the wrapper entirely, leaving
// the shared core (asyncWriter channel, configHolder, states) untouched.
//
// The core's Register is forwarded verbatim: each Runner ends up with its
// own plugin.Registry that calls straight into the shared core's hot-path
// callbacks. The core is already safe for concurrent use across Runners
// because per-invocation state is keyed by invocationID (sync.Map).

// per-invocation state (keyed by invocationID) and never mutate shared
// construction-time fields.

// must not be done without replacing the wrapper mechanism.
