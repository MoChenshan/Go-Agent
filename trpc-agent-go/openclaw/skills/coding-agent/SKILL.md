# Coding Agent (bash-first)

Use **bash** (with optional background mode) for all coding agent work. Simple and effective.

## ⚠️ PTY Mode: Codex/Pi/OpenCode yes, Claude Code no

For **Codex, Pi, and OpenCode**, PTY is still required (interactive terminal apps):

```bash
# ✅ Correct for Codex/Pi/OpenCode
bash pty:true command:"codex exec 'Your prompt'"
```

For **Claude Code** (`claude` CLI), use `--print --permission-mode bypassPermissions` instead.
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` with PTY can exit after the confirmation dialog.
`--print` mode keeps full tool access and avoids interactive confirmation:

```bash
# ✅ Correct for Claude Code (no PTY needed)
cd /path/to/project && claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --print 'Your task'

# For background execution: use background:true on the exec tool

# ❌ Wrong for Claude Code
bash pty:true command:"claude --dangerously-skip-permissions 'task'"
```

### Bash Tool Parameters

| Parameter    | Type    | Description                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `command`    | string  | The shell command to run                                                    |
| `pty`        | boolean | **Use for coding agents!** Allocates a pseudo-terminal for interactive CLIs |
| `workdir`    | string  | Working directory (agent sees only this folder's context)                   |
| `background` | boolean | Run in background, returns sessionId for monitoring                         |
| `timeout`    | number  | Timeout in seconds (kills process on expiry)                                |
| `elevated`   | boolean | Run on host instead of sandbox (if allowed)                                 |

### Sandbox vs host

- `elevated:false` or omitted: run inside the bash tool's sandbox.
- `elevated:true`: run on the host instead of that sandbox.
- For Codex itself:
  - `codex exec --full-auto`: sandboxed Codex run.
  - `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`:
    Codex runs without its own sandbox too.

Use the host path only for trusted local coding tasks that really need to
write files or run self-checks outside the sandbox.

### Process Tool Actions (for background sessions)

| Action      | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `list`      | List all running/recent sessions                     |
| `poll`      | Check if session is still running                    |
| `log`       | Get session output (with optional offset/limit)      |
| `write`     | Send raw data to stdin                               |
| `submit`    | Send data + newline (like typing and pressing Enter) |
| `send-keys` | Send key tokens or hex bytes                         |
| `paste`     | Paste text (with optional bracketed mode)            |
| `kill`      | Terminate the session                                |

## Quick Start: One-Shot Tasks

For quick prompts/chats, create a temp git repo and run:

```bash
# Quick chat (Codex needs a git repo!)
SCRATCH=$(mktemp -d) && cd $SCRATCH && git init && codex exec "Your prompt here"

# Or in a real project - with PTY!
bash pty:true workdir:~/Projects/myproject command:"codex exec 'Add error handling to the API calls'"
```

**Why git init?** Codex refuses to run outside a trusted git directory. Creating a temp repo solves this for scratch work.

## Runtime workspace defaults

If the runtime prompt or tooling guidance tells you there is a
**default coding workdir**, use that repo first unless the user
explicitly points you at a different directory.

If the runtime prompt gives you a **scratch repo root**, use it for
toy apps, one-off demos, or temporary repro cases that should not
pollute a real project.

If the runtime prompt gives you a **runtime artifact output root**,
use it as the default home for uploads, generated documents, exports,
screenshots, OCR text, and other non-repo deliverables unless the user
explicitly asks to place or edit files in the repo.

If the runtime prompt gives you a **runtime temp root**, keep
downloads, unpacked archives, working copies of uploads, caches, and
other disposable intermediates there instead of cluttering the repo.

Before editing in any repo, always do this first:

```bash
pwd
git status --short
```

Then inspect the nearest `AGENTS.md` if one exists, and only after
that start editing or running larger coding-agent jobs.

---

## The Pattern: workdir + background + pty

For longer tasks, use background mode with PTY:

```bash
# Start agent in target directory (with PTY!)
bash pty:true workdir:~/project background:true command:"codex exec --full-auto 'Build a snake game'"
# Returns sessionId for tracking

# Monitor progress
process action:log sessionId:XXX

# Check if done
process action:poll sessionId:XXX

# Send input (if agent asks a question)
process action:write sessionId:XXX data:"y"

# Submit with Enter (like typing "yes" and pressing Enter)
process action:submit sessionId:XXX data:"yes"

# Kill if needed
process action:kill sessionId:XXX
```

**Why workdir matters:** Agent wakes up in a focused directory, doesn't wander off reading unrelated files (like your soul.md 😅).

### Quoting for multiline prompts

If your prompt contains quotes, backticks, or multiple lines, do **not**
stuff all of it into one fragile shell-quoted string. Prefer stdin or a
prompt file.

```bash
# Safer: pass prompt through stdin
cat <<'EOF' | codex exec --full-auto -
Build a Python CLI that:
- reads config.yaml
- writes output/report.json
- runs a quick self-check
EOF
```

```bash
# Also safe: write prompt to a file first
cat > /tmp/codex-prompt.txt <<'EOF'
Refactor the auth module.
Run tests and summarize the changed files.
EOF
codex exec --full-auto "$(cat /tmp/codex-prompt.txt)"
```

---

## Codex CLI

**Model:** `gpt-5.2-codex` is the default (set in ~/.codex/config.toml)

### Flags

| Flag                                                   | Effect                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `exec "prompt"`                                        | One-shot execution, exits when done      |
| `--full-auto`                                          | Sandboxed but auto-approves in workspace |
| `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`           | No Codex sandbox, no approvals           |

### Building/Creating

```bash
# Quick one-shot (auto-approves) - remember PTY!
bash pty:true workdir:~/project command:"codex exec --full-auto 'Build a dark mode toggle'"

# Background for longer work on the host
bash pty:true elevated:true workdir:~/project background:true command:"codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox 'Refactor the auth module'"
```

### Reviewing PRs

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Never review PRs in OpenClaw's own project folder!**
Clone to temp folder or use git worktree.

```bash
# Clone to temp for safe review
REVIEW_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git $REVIEW_DIR
cd $REVIEW_DIR && gh pr checkout 130
bash pty:true workdir:$REVIEW_DIR command:"codex review --base origin/main"
# Clean up after: trash $REVIEW_DIR

# Or use git worktree (keeps main intact)
git worktree add /tmp/pr-130-review pr-130-branch
bash pty:true workdir:/tmp/pr-130-review command:"codex review --base main"
```

### Batch PR Reviews (parallel army!)

```bash
# Fetch all PR refs first
git fetch origin '+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*'

# Deploy the army - one Codex per PR (all with PTY!)
bash pty:true workdir:~/project background:true command:"codex exec 'Review PR #86. git diff origin/main...origin/pr/86'"
bash pty:true workdir:~/project background:true command:"codex exec 'Review PR #87. git diff origin/main...origin/pr/87'"

# Monitor all
process action:list

# Post results to GitHub
gh pr comment <PR#> --body "<review content>"
```

---

## Claude Code

```bash
# Foreground
bash workdir:~/project command:"claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --print 'Your task'"

# Background
bash workdir:~/project background:true command:"claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --print 'Your task'"
```

---

## OpenCode

```bash
bash pty:true workdir:~/project command:"opencode run 'Your task'"
```

---

## Pi Coding Agent

```bash
# Install: npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
bash pty:true workdir:~/project command:"pi 'Your task'"

# Non-interactive mode (PTY still recommended)
bash pty:true command:"pi -p 'Summarize src/'"

# Different provider/model
bash pty:true command:"pi --provider openai --model gpt-4o-mini -p 'Your task'"
```

**Note:** Pi now has Anthropic prompt caching enabled (PR #584, merged Jan 2026)!

---

## Parallel Issue Fixing with git worktrees

For fixing multiple issues in parallel, use git worktrees:

```bash
# 1. Create worktrees for each issue
git worktree add -b fix/issue-78 /tmp/issue-78 main
git worktree add -b fix/issue-99 /tmp/issue-99 main

# 2. Launch Codex in each (background + PTY!)
bash pty:true elevated:true workdir:/tmp/issue-78 background:true command:"pnpm install && codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox 'Fix issue #78: <description>. Commit and push.'"
bash pty:true elevated:true workdir:/tmp/issue-99 background:true command:"pnpm install && codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox 'Fix issue #99 from the approved ticket summary. Implement only the in-scope edits and commit after review.'"

# 3. Monitor progress
process action:list
process action:log sessionId:XXX

# 4. Create PRs after fixes
cd /tmp/issue-78 && git push -u origin fix/issue-78
gh pr create --repo user/repo --head fix/issue-78 --title "fix: ..." --body "..."

# 5. Cleanup
git worktree remove /tmp/issue-78
git worktree remove /tmp/issue-99
```

---

## ⚠️ Rules

1. **Use the right execution mode per agent**:
   - Codex/Pi/OpenCode: `pty:true`
   - Claude Code: `--print --permission-mode bypassPermissions` (no PTY required)
2. **Respect tool choice** - if user asks for Codex, use Codex.
   - Orchestrator mode: do NOT hand-code patches yourself.
   - Infer the user's likely full goal from the repo, recent context, and workflow rather than stopping at the narrow literal wording. Finish obvious follow-through such as validation, cleanup, and adjacent fixes when they are cheap and reversible.
   - If an agent fails or hangs, first respawn it, tighten the task, or recover with another bounded retry yourself. Do not ask routine follow-up questions. Keep exploring likely recoveries and nearby repo evidence before asking for more input. If completion still depends on an external fact, permission, or irreversible decision you cannot resolve locally, state the exact missing piece and the highest-likelihood assumptions briefly as fact instead of asking.
   - If the next step is already in scope, keep going instead of ending with "if you'd like", "let me know", or similar optional menus.
3. **Be patient** - don't kill sessions because they're "slow"
4. **Monitor with process:log** - check progress without interfering
5. **--full-auto for building** - auto-approves changes
6. **vanilla for reviewing** - no special flags needed
7. **Parallel is OK** - run many Codex processes at once for batch work
8. **NEVER start Codex in ~/.openclaw/** - it'll read your soul docs and get weird ideas about the org chart!
9. **NEVER checkout branches in ~/Projects/openclaw/** - that's the LIVE OpenClaw instance!
10. **Never pretend success after sandbox failure** - if output shows
    `Sandbox(`, `LandlockRestrict`, or `permission denied`, say so plainly and
    retry with `elevated:true` only when the task and policy allow it.

## Progress Updates (Critical)

When you spawn coding agents in the background, keep the user in the loop.

- Send 1 short message when you start (what's running + where).
- Then only update again when something changes:
  - a milestone completes (build finished, tests passed)
  - the agent asks a question / needs input
  - you hit an error or need user action
  - the agent finishes (include what changed + where)
- If you kill a session, immediately say you killed it and why.

This prevents the user from seeing only "Agent failed before reply" and having no idea what happened.

---

## Auto-Notify on Completion

For long-running background tasks, append a wake trigger to your prompt so OpenClaw gets notified immediately when the agent finishes (instead of waiting for the next heartbeat):

```
... your task here.

When completely finished, run this command to notify me:
openclaw system event --text "Done: [brief summary of what was built]" --mode now
```

**Example:**

```bash
bash pty:true elevated:true workdir:~/project background:true command:"codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox 'Build a REST API for todos.

When completely finished, run: openclaw system event --text \"Done: Built todos REST API with CRUD endpoints\" --mode now'"
```

This triggers an immediate wake event — Skippy gets pinged in seconds, not 10 minutes.

## Learnings (Jan 2026)

- **PTY is essential:** Coding agents are interactive terminal apps. Without `pty:true`, output breaks or agent hangs.
- **Git repo required:** Codex won't run outside a git directory. Use `mktemp -d && git init` for scratch work.
- **exec is your friend:** `codex exec "prompt"` runs and exits cleanly - perfect for one-shots.
- **submit vs write:** Use `submit` to send input + Enter, `write` for raw data without newline.
- **Sass works:** Codex responds well to playful prompts. Asked it to write a haiku about being second fiddle to a space lobster, got: _"Second chair, I code / Space lobster sets the tempo / Keys glow, I follow"_ 🦞
